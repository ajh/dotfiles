The directory 'configs' contains my dotfiles and configs for a linux environment. 

They can be installed by the following rake commands:
    rake -T # to see tasks 
    rake install # to install configs

The submodules can be updated by running these commands, then committing the changes:
    git submodule foreach git checkout master
    git submodule foreach git pull
